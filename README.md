- **No Storage**: Sensitive information is immediately replaced and never stored
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for review
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for AI platform interaction

## üìã Chrome Web Store Privacy Compliance

### Single Purpose
SecureGPT has a single, narrow purpose: **automatically detect and replace sensitive information (PII, credit cards, API keys, etc.) with safe placeholders when using AI chat platforms**. This protects user privacy by preventing accidental sharing of sensitive data with AI services.

### Permission Justifications

#### activeTab Permission
**Purpose**: Required to inject content scripts into AI chat platform tabs and monitor text input fields for sensitive information detection.

**Justification**: The extension needs to access the active tab to:
- Monitor text input fields on AI chat platforms
- Inject the De-PII button into chat interfaces
- Detect and replace sensitive information in real-time
- Work across multiple AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

#### storage Permission
**Purpose**: Required to save user configuration settings and preferences.

**Justification**: The extension needs to store:
- User's detection pattern preferences (enabled/disabled patterns)
- Custom placeholder text for each data type
- Website management settings (which AI platforms to protect)
- Ignore list entries
- General settings (notifications, auto-scan, etc.)

#### Host Permissions
**Purpose**: Required to inject content scripts and access AI chat platform websites.

**Justification**: The extension requires access to these specific AI platforms:
- `https://chat.openai.com/*` and `https://chatgpt.com/*` - ChatGPT platforms
- `https://claude.ai/*` - Anthropic Claude
- `https://gemini.google.com/*` - Google Gemini
- `https://ai.meta.com/*` - Meta LLaMA
- `https://mistral.ai/*` - Mistral AI
- `https://x.ai/*` - xAI Grok
- `https://cohere.com/*` - Cohere
- `https://www.perplexity.ai/*` - Perplexity AI

Each host permission is necessary to:
- Inject content scripts for sensitive data detection
- Access text input fields on these platforms
- Provide real-time protection across all supported AI services
- Maintain consistent functionality across different AI platforms

### Remote Code Usage
**No Remote Code**: This extension does not use any remote code. All JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files are included in the extension package. No external scripts, modules, or evaluated code strings are used.

**Verification**: All code is:
- Included in the extension package
- No external script references
- No dynamic code evaluation
- No remote module imports
- No external API calls for code execution

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Content Script Injection**: Monitors textarea inputs on ChatGPT pages
2. **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns to identify sensitive information
3. **Real-time Replacement**: Replaces detected patterns with placeholders
4. **Form Interception**: Catches submissions at multiple levels (paste, input, submit)
5. **Deep Integration**: Includes injected scripts to catch API calls and XHR requests

### Supported Websites
- **ChatGPT**: chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com
- **Claude**: claude.ai
- **Gemini**: gemini.google.com
- **LLaMA**: ai.meta.com
- **Mistral AI**: mistral.ai
- **Grok**: x.ai
- **Cohere**: cohere.com
- **Perplexity AI**: perplexity.ai

### Detection Patterns
The extension uses carefully crafted regex patterns to detect:

```javascript
// Email addresses
email: /\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b/gi

// Phone numbers (US and international)
phone: /(\+?1[-.\s]?)?\(?[0-9]{3}\)?[-.\s]?[0-9]{3}[-.\s]?[0-9]{4}\b/g
phoneInternational: /\+[1-9]\d{1,14}\b/g

// Social Security Numbers
ssn: /\b\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}\b/g

// Credit card numbers (specific and generic)
creditCard: /\b(?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?|5[1-5][0-9]{14}|3[47][0-9]{13}|3[0-9]{13}|6(?:011|5[0-9]{2})[0-9]{12})\b/g
creditCardGeneric: /\b\d{13,19}\b/g

// API keys, IP addresses, bank accounts, passports, addresses
// ... and more sophisticated patterns
```
