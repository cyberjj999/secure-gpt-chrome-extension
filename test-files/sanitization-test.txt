When you drop this file into ChatGPT or Claude, SecureGPT should:
1. Detect the sensitive data
2. Automatically replace it with placeholders
3. Upload the sanitized version to the AI platform
4. Show you what was sanitized

Expected result: All sensitive data should be replaced with [EMAIL_REDACTED], [PHONE_REDACTED], [SSN_REDACTED], [CREDIT_CARD_REDACTED], etc.
