Quick Drag Test File

This is a simple test file to verify that the drag and drop indicator bug has been fixed.

Sensitive data for testing:
- Email: test@example.com
- Phone: (555) 123-4567
- SSN: 123-45-6789
- Credit Card: 4532-1234-5678-9012

When you drag this file over the input field, you should see:

2. No repeated or duplicate indicators
3. Clean visual feedback without flickering

The bug where multiple indicators appeared when hovering should now be fixed.
